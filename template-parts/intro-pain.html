                    <p>If you're a healthcare executive, wellness leader, provider, or purpose-driven organization constantly pushing through stress, high turnover, and silent suffering—you're not alone.</p>
                    
                    <p>What you’re facing isn’t simple stress; it’s systemic burnout — the invisible loop of over-functioning, people-pleasing, emotional compression, and chronic energetic depletion that keeps even the most capable leaders in survival mode. It often looks like waking up tired no matter how much you rest, losing focus or patience, feeling detached from your purpose, or carrying tension that never fully releases.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cost is more than fatigue — clarity erodes, creativity dulls, and the very mission that once inspired you starts to feel heavy. This isn't about managing stress. It's about <strong>dismantling the system</strong> that's keeping you and your team stuck in survival mode.</p>
