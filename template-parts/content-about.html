                        <p>Welcome to Soul Suite Wellness™, where transformation meets intention — and leaders come home to themselves. I’m Soulara Sevier, an Intuitive Executive Function Coach, Certified Reiki Master Teacher, Author, and Founder & CEO of Soul Suite Wellness. My work sits at the intersection of science and soul, guiding high-impact healthcare and wellness leaders back to clarity, balance, and authentic alignment.</p>
                        
                        <p>With over 25 years of experience spanning psychology, cardiac nursing, and energy healing, I’ve witnessed firsthand how systemic burnout erodes not just performance — but purpose. That’s why I created the WellSR™ Portal, a restorative coaching space that blends evidence-based executive function support with intuitive practices like Reiki and somatic recalibration, helping clients move beyond survival and into sustainable coherence.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a leader in transformational wellness for both micro and enterprise organizations, I partner with executives, teams, and organizations ready to address the root causes of burnout, disconnection, and disengagement. Through workshops, executive recalibration consults, and immersive retreats, we cultivate emotionally intelligent leadership and cultures where people thrive because they feel seen, valued, and supported.
</p>
                        
                        <p>At Soul Suite Wellness™, this isn’t about surface-level wellness — it’s about deep, systemic transformation. Together, we bridge performance with humanity, resilience with restoration, and ambition with ease — so you and your teams can lead from alignment, not exhaustion.</p>
